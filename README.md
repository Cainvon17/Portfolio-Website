# ðŸ’¼ My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a simple, static website built using HTML and CSS to showcase my projects, contact information, and a brief introduction about myself.


##Overview of the task

This is my first web development project â€” a fully responsive portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for form validation and interactive elements. Iâ€™ve implemented Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure the layout adapts smoothly across different devices. The typography is powered by Google Fonts, giving the site a modern, clean look, while carefully selected Pinterest-sourced visuals bring personality and style to the design.

The goal was to combine aesthetic appeal with functional simplicity, creating a portfolio that not only represents my skills but also lays the foundation for my journey in web design and development.
